The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect,
work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that
can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a
series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required
to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github
repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code
book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or
work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You
should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo
explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected. 

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is
wearable computing - see for example this article
<http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/>.
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the
most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from
the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from
the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the
site where the data was obtained:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones


Here are the data for the project:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip


 You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the
following. 

 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
    for each measurement. 
 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
 5.

    From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data
    set with the average of each variable for each activity and each
    subject.

Good luck!

Please upload the tidy data set created in step 5 of the instructions.
Please upload your data set as a txt file created with write.table()
using row.name=FALSE (do not cut and paste a dataset directly into the
text box, as this may cause errors saving your submission).

      Evaluation/feedback on the above work

*Note*: this section can only be filled out during the evaluation phase.
Has the student submitted a tidy data set? 
Please submit a link to a Github repo with the code for performing your
analysis. The code should have a file run_analysis.R in the main
directory that can be run as long as the Samsung data is in your working
directory. The output should be the tidy data set you submitted for part
1. You should include a README.md in the repo describing how the script
works and the code book describing the variables.

      Evaluation/feedback on the above work

*Note*: this section can only be filled out during the evaluation phase.
Did the student submit a Github repo with the required scripts?

Was code book submitted to GitHub that modifies and updates the
codebooks available to you with the data to indicate all the variables
and summaries you calculated, along with units, and any other relevant
information?

I was able to follow the README in the directory that explained what the
analysis files did.
